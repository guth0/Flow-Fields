# Flow Fields
---
## Desription
---
This is a simulation of flow fields. It uses [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) to generate a Psudo-Random vector field that particles will travel across. This leads to beautiful wave like movements of the particles. The particles are also equiped with a tail that traces where they have been. I am using Ryo Suzuki's perlin noise library to generate my vector field.

## Customization
---
I am currently in the process of centralizing all of the settings but, as of now, most things can be changed inside of Simulation::Simulation()
